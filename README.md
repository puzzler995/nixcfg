# Kat's Nix Config
Welcome to my personal homelab and desktop Nix config! 
This is still super under construction, but it's mostly usable as of now.

Big thanks to the awesome [Aly Raffauf](https://aly.codes/), without whom this wouldn't have happened. A lof of this is based on her much more [competent and complete config](https://github.com/alyraffauf/nixcfg)
